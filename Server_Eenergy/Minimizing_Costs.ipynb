    "# Reducing costs of data center cooling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will configure our own server environment and build an AI that will control\n",
    "the cooling/heating of the server to keep it in an optimal temperature range and\n",
    "at the same time we need to save the maximum energy, thus minimizing costs. Our\n",
    "goal will be to achieve at least 40% energy savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 - Boundary Conditions and program operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average atmospheric temperature for a month.\n",
    "* The optimal range of server temperature: **[15ºC, 25ºC]**.\n",
    "* The minimum server temperature: **-25ºC** (it doesn't operate below).\n",
    "* The maximum server temperature:  **80ºC** (it doesn't work above).\n",
    "* The minimum number of users on the server: **8**.\n",
    "* The maximum number of users on the server: **120**.\n",
    "* The maximum number of users on the server that it can up or down per minute:\n",
    "**6**.\n",
    "* The minimum data transmission rate on the server: **20**.\n",
    "* The maximum data transmission speed on the server: **400**.\n",
    "* The maximum data transmission speed that can go up or down per minute: **10**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Server temperature at any time.\n",
    "* Number of users on the server at any time.\n",
    "* Data transmission speed at any minute\n",
    "* AI's energy expended on the server (to cool or heat it) at any time.\n",
    "* The energy expended by the server's integrated cooling system that\n",
    "automatically brings the server temperature to the optimal range whenever the\n",
    "server temperature is out of this optimal range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We are going to make two assumptions to facilitate the work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the server temperature can be approximated by Multiple Linear\n",
    "Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Server \\hspace{2mm} temp. = a_0 + b_1 \\cdot atmosph. temp. + b_2 \\cdot\n",

    "\n",
    "where $a_0 \\in \\mathbb R$, $b_1,b_2,b_3 > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the atmospheric temperature rieses, the server temperature rises too. The\n",
    "more users are active on the server, the more the server will spend to handle\n",
    "them, and therefore the server temperature will be higher. And finally, the more\n",
    "data is transmitted within the server, the more the server will spend to process\n",
    "it, and therefore the higher the server temperature will be. And for simplicity,\n",
    "we just assume these correlations are linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to give values to parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Server \\hspace{2mm} temp. = 0 + 1 \\cdot atmosph. temp. + 1.3 \\cdot Num.users +\n",
    "1.3 \\cdot data\\hspace{2mm} trans.rate$$\n",

    "to its optimal temperature.\n",
    "The integrated system(no-IA) works only when IA system not work. If IA is\n",
    "enabled, no-IA is disabled and then the IA updates the server temperature. The\n",
    "IA system is non-deterministic because it predicts what temperatureto set based\n",
    "on the previous parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IA must spend less energy than the intern cooling system. Therefore we can\n",
